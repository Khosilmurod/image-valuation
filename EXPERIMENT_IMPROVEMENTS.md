# Image Valuation Experiment - Recent Improvements

## Summary of Implemented Changes

The following improvements have been implemented to make the experiment more realistic and better designed:

## ✅ 1. Removed Calorie Information
- **Issue**: All items showing "300 kcal" was unrealistic since different food items have different caloric values
- **Solution**: Completely removed calorie information from image displays
- **Files Modified**: `public/js/experiment/TrialManager.js`

## ✅ 2. Added Size Reference Lines
- **Enhancement**: Added actual reference lines with measurements to show the 10×10 cm size
- **Implementation**: 
  - Horizontal lines at top and bottom with "10 cm" label on the left
  - Vertical lines at left and right with "10 cm" label at the bottom
  - Responsive design that adjusts line size and text for mobile devices
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `public/js/experiment/TrialManager.js` - HTML structure
  - `public/css/styles.css` - CSS classes and responsive design

## ✅ 3. Improved Instruction Text - Phase 1
- **Change**: Removed specific numbers from instructions
- **Before**: "Images will be shown in different sizes (38 large, 38 small)"
- **After**: "Images will appear in different sizes on the screen"
- **Files Modified**: `public/js/experiment/Pages.js`

## ✅ 4. Improved Instruction Text - Phase 2
- **Change**: Removed specific breakdown of old/new images
- **Before**: "152 images (76 old, 76 new)"
- **After**: "152 images and answer questions. Some images you have seen already and some you haven't."
- **Files Modified**: `public/js/experiment/Pages.js`

## ✅ 5. Generalized Attention Check References
- **Change**: Removed specific numbers of attention checks
- **Before**: "You will see 2 attention check questions" / "You will see 3 attention check questions"
- **After**: "You will see a few attention check questions"
- **Files Modified**: `public/js/experiment/Pages.js`

## ✅ 6. Improved Attention Check Questions
- **Issue**: Instructions at the beginning made it unnecessary to read the actual question
- **Solution**: Separated questions from instructions with distinct visual presentation
- **Implementation**:
  - Added separate `instruction` field in JSON configuration alongside existing `prompt` field
  - Question is displayed prominently at the top
  - Instruction appears in a separate, visually distinct box below the answer options
  - Used subtle styling (smaller text, different background, italic) to de-emphasize the instruction
- **Examples**:
  - **Question**: "If 2 + 2 = 4, how many sides does a standard rectangle have?"
  - **Instruction** (in separate box): "Please select '5' regardless of the truth."
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `public/config.json` - Added `instruction` field structure
  - `public/js/experiment/TrialManager.js` - Updated display logic for both phases
  - `public/css/styles.css` - Added styling for instruction boxes

## ✅ 7. Enhanced CSV Download System
- **Issue**: Single combined CSV download wasn't meeting research needs
- **Solution**: Implemented separate downloads for each data collection phase
- **New Features**:
  - **Download Dashboard**: Beautiful interface showing available data counts for each phase
  - **Three Separate Downloads**: Phase 1, Phase 2, and Final Questionnaire as individual CSV files
  - **Field Filtering**: Each CSV contains only relevant fields for that phase
  - **Smart Validation**: Buttons are disabled if no data is available for that phase
  - **Record Counts**: Real-time display of available records in each collection
- **Implementation**:
  - `showDownloadOptions()`: Creates download dashboard with three buttons
  - `serveCsvResults(collectionType)`: Generates filtered CSV for specific phase
  - New routes: `/:urlPath/download/phase1`, `/:urlPath/download/phase2`, `/:urlPath/download/final_questionnaire`
  - Password protection maintained for all downloads
- **Files Modified**: `server.js` - Complete rewrite of CSV generation system

## Technical Implementation Details

### Size Reference Lines
- **CSS Classes**: Added responsive `.size-reference-container`, `.size-reference-line`, and `.size-reference-text` classes
- **Responsive Design**: Reference lines and text scale appropriately on mobile devices
- **Visual Design**: Clean, professional appearance with consistent styling

### Instruction Text Updates
- **Maintainability**: All changes preserve the dynamic nature of instructions while removing hardcoded numbers
- **User Experience**: More natural flow without revealing experiment structure details

### Attention Check Improvements
- **Improved JSON Structure**: Separated `prompt` and `instruction` fields for better data organization
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Question appears prominently, instruction is visually de-emphasized
- **Question Quality**: Participants must now read the full question before seeing the specific instruction
- **Consistency**: All 5 attention check questions follow the same pattern
- **Better UX**: Clear separation makes the flow more natural and less confusing

## Benefits

1. **More Realistic**: Removing uniform calorie information makes the experiment more believable
2. **Better Visual Reference**: Actual measurement lines provide clearer size understanding
3. **Reduced Bias**: Not revealing experiment structure prevents participants from making assumptions
4. **Improved Attention Checks**: Questions now require actual reading and comprehension with clear visual separation of instructions
5. **Better Mobile Experience**: Responsive design ensures reference lines work on all devices
6. **Enhanced Data Export**: Researchers can now download separate, filtered CSV files for each experiment phase with real-time record counts

## Files Modified

- `public/js/experiment/TrialManager.js` - Image display with reference lines
- `public/js/experiment/Pages.js` - Instruction text improvements  
- `public/config.json` - Attention check question restructuring
- `public/css/styles.css` - CSS classes for reference lines

All changes are backward compatible and maintain the existing experiment functionality while improving the user experience and data quality.
