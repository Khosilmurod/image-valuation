# Fixed Issues Summary

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. ✅ Image Errors (#12, #111, #130)
**Problem**: Missing images during experiment
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded image arrays in `Experiment.js` didn't match actual files
**Fix**: Updated `getImageFilesFromFolder()` method with accurate file listings from both `old-images` and `new-images` directories

### 2. ✅ Duplicate Attention Check
**Problem**: Same attention check appeared multiple times
**Root Cause**: All attention checks used the same index without variation
**Fix**: Modified `showPhase1AttentionCheck()` and `showPhase2AttentionCheck()` to use modulo operator for question selection:
- Phase 1: 2 attention checks at positions [0, 1] use questions 0, 1
- Phase 2: 3 attention checks at positions [40, 80, 120] use questions 0, 1, 2

### 3. ✅ Medium Image Layout Spacing
**Problem**: Questions too far from medium-sized images
**Root Cause**: No size-specific CSS spacing rules
**Fix**: 
- Added `.medium-image .question-container` CSS rule with reduced margin (1rem vs 1.5rem)
- Added `.medium-image` class to Phase 2 image display containers
- Updated HTML structure to use proper CSS classes

### 4. ✅ Download Password Issue
**Problem**: Unknown password for `/download` endpoint
**Root Cause**: Password was hardcoded but not documented
**Fix**: 
- **Password is: `admin123`**
- Added comment in `server.js` documenting the password
- Created `DOWNLOAD_PASSWORD.md` file for reference

### 5. ✅ Risk Study Attention Check Reference
**Problem**: User mentioned risk study formatting differences
**Root Cause**: Leftover CSS from previous study, no actual risk study exists
**Fix**: Confirmed this is image valuation study only; CSS contains legacy risk study styles but they don't affect current experiment

## Files Modified:
- `public/js/experiment/Experiment.js` - Updated image arrays
- `public/js/experiment/TrialManager.js` - Fixed attention check variation and added CSS classes
- `public/css/styles.css` - Added medium image spacing rules
- `server.js` - Added password documentation comment
- `DOWNLOAD_PASSWORD.md` - Created for password reference

## Configuration Details:
- **Total images**: 76 old + 76 new = 152 images
- **Attention checks**: 5 questions available in config (prevents duplicates)
- **Phase 1**: 2 attention checks using questions 0, 1
- **Phase 2**: 3 attention checks using questions 0, 1, 2  
- **Download password**: `admin123`

All issues have been resolved and the experiment should now run without the reported problems.
