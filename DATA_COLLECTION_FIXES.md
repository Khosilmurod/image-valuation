# Data Collection System Improvements

## Summary of Issues Fixed

The image valuation experiment had several critical data collection issues that have been comprehensively addressed:

## 1. Major Issues Resolved

### ❌ **Phase 1 Data Collection Was Missing**
- **Problem**: Phase 1 images were displayed but NO data was being collected
- **Fix**: Added `recordPhase1ImageData()` method that captures:
  - Image ID, filename, and size
  - Actual display duration (vs. configured duration)
  - Viewing timestamps
  - Session tracking

### ❌ **Attention Check Positions Were Impossible**
- **Problem**: Config had attention checks at positions 35, 70 for Phase 1 (only 4 images total)
- **Fix**: Updated to realistic positions (3 for Phase 1, 4 for Phase 2)

### ❌ **Inconsistent Data Structure**
- **Problem**: CSV headers defined but data collection didn't match
- **Fix**: Standardized all data entries to match exact CSV header format with proper field ordering

### ❌ **Missing Response Time Tracking**
- **Problem**: No timing data for attention checks or image responses
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive timing for all interactions:
  - Attention check response times
  - Phase 2 response times  
  - Phase 1 actual display durations

### ❌ **Poor Data Validation**
- **Problem**: No validation before sending data to server
- **Fix**: Added multi-level validation:
  - Client-side data validation before submission
  - Server-side field validation with type conversion
  - Row-by-row error handling and logging

### ❌ **Server Data Processing Issues**
- **Problem**: Basic CSV parsing with poor error handling
- **Fix**: Robust server-side processing:
  - Proper CSV parsing with quote handling
  - Type conversion for numeric/boolean fields
  - Comprehensive error logging and validation
  - Better database insertion with error recovery

## 2. New Features Added

### ✅ **Comprehensive Session Tracking**
- Unique session IDs with timestamp and random components
- Session metadata saved with all data entries
- Better debugging information in error messages

### ✅ **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**
- Detailed console logging for all data collection events
- Sample data logging for verification
- Participant and entry type summaries
- Warning system for data inconsistencies

### ✅ **Better User Experience**
- Visual feedback during data submission
- Validation prompts for incomplete responses
- Default value checking for questionnaires
- Improved error messages with debug information

### ✅ **Robust Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Proper error messages for participants
- Server-side error recovery
- Comprehensive validation at multiple levels

## 3. Data Structure Improvements

### Before:
- Phase 1: No data collected
- Phase 2: Basic response data only
- Attention checks: Missing timing data
- Final questions: Inconsistent formatting

### After:
All data entries follow consistent CSV format with these fields:
```
participant_id, entry_type, phase, image_id, filename, image_size, image_type, 
memory_response, payment_response, confidence, response_time, attention_check_id, 
attention_response, attention_correct, snack_preference, desire_to_eat, hunger, 
fullness, satisfaction, eating_capacity, session_id, timestamp
```

### Entry Types Now Collected:
1. **phase1_image** - Image viewing data for Phase 1
2. **phase2_response** - Memory and valuation responses
3. **attention_check** - Attention check responses with timing
4. **final_questionnaire** - Final preference questions
5. **session_info** - Session metadata

## 4. Technical Improvements

### Client-Side:
- Added `validateExperimentData()` method
- Improved `parseCSVRow()` for proper CSV handling
- Enhanced error display with debug information
- Better session ID generation

### Server-Side:
- Robust field type conversion (numeric, boolean, string)
- Proper null value handling
- Enhanced error logging and recovery
- Better database validation

## 5. Configuration Updates

Updated `config.json` with realistic settings:
- Phase 1: 1 attention check at position 3 (out of 4 images)
- Phase 2: 1 attention check at position 4 (out of 6 images)
- Maintained all other experimental parameters

## 6. Data Quality Assurance

### Validation Checks:
- ✅ Subject ID presence
- ✅ Data completeness
- ✅ Expected entry types
- ✅ Field count validation
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Type conversion validation

### Logging Features:
- ✅ Real-time data collection logging
- ✅ Server processing summaries
- ✅ Error tracking and reporting
- ✅ Participant activity tracking

## 7. Migration Notes

**No breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved while adding comprehensive data collection. The improvements are backward compatible and enhance the existing system without disrupting the experimental flow.

## 8. Testing Recommendations

1. **Run a complete experiment** to verify all data collection points
2. **Check the database** to ensure all entry types are being saved
3. **Review logs** for any validation warnings
4. **Export CSV data** to verify field consistency and completeness

---

**Result**: The data collection system is now comprehensive, robust, and provides complete experimental data tracking with proper validation and error handling.
